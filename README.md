### Open Door Code Challenge
Some other things to work on:
I would like to have other filters available in the API. The user should be able to filter on the status, define the range of square footage, and if this were a backend to an application with a map, a range for latitude and longitude based on some type of map zooming would be nice. Also, I would define a default number of records to return, but make that accessible as well.
